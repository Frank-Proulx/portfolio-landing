      <p>I earned a bachelor's degree in Economics from the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, after which I worked in the restaurant industry for many years, starting as a server, then becoming a manager of one of the busiest and most popular restaurants in Los Angeles. From there I was promoted to General Manager of their catering division, where I managed all the operations for a large commisary kitchen specializing in high-end events, corporate contracts and production for the entire restaurant group.</p>
