# Portfolio Landing Page

#### By Frank Proulx

#### A portfolio website highlighting me and the work I've done as a developer.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

## Description

This site is intended to give me a chance to practice what I've learned so far, putting together a portfolio website using basic HTML and CSS/Bootstrap to serve as a template for a future professional portfolio site. It highlights what I've done so far, some general information about me, and provides links to my GitHub repositories so that potential future employers can see my work and get to know me.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Initialize a git repository by typing **git init** in the terminal.
