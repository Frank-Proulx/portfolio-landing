# Portfolio Landing Page

#### By Frank Proulx

#### A portfolio website highlighting me and the work I've done as a developer.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

## Description

This site is intended to give me a chance to practice what I've learned so far, putting together a portfolio website using basic HTML and CSS/Bootstrap to serve as a template for a future professional portfolio site. It highlights what I've done so far, some general information about me, and provides links to my GitHub repositories so that potential future employers can see my work and get to know me.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Navigate to the directory you would like to use for this project on your computer.
* Initialize a git repository using **git init** in the terminal.
* Type **git clone https://github.com/Frank-Proulx/portfolio-landing** to clone the repository to your local machine.
* Open the file "index.html" using either the GUI in your finder window, or typing **open index.html** in the terminal from within your chosen project folder.

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_
